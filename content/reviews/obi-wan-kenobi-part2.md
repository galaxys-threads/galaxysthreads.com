Another really strong episode. I feel like the stage is set, and we are ready to get into the meat of this show starting with Part 3.

{{< spoiler-warning >}}

## Clone War Veteran
This was really cool to see in a sad way. We've always wondered what happened to all of the Clones after the Empire took over, but this brings a new level of realism to the Star Wars Universe. A

Also I'm glad they got Temuera Morrison to play the part.

## Haja
I love the idea of swindlers pretending to be Jedi. He added a nice level of humor to this otherwise serious episode.

## Breaking Bad
Spice lab? Spice house? I don't know, but yet another example of this show bringing more realism to the Star Wars universe.

## Reva
She is proving to be smarter than the rest of the Inquisitors but also more wild. This makes her extra dangerous.

## Anakin Skywalker Is Alive
I'm happy with the way Obi-Wan found out that Anakin is still alive. Reva "spilling the beans" so nonchalantly and then they both immediately realized the significance of what was just learned.

## Grand Inquisitor
I guess he can not be dead? I'm assuming that he is the same Grand Inquisitor we see in Rebels. Maybe not?
