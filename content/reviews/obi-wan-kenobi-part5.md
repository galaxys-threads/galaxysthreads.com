## Prequel Flashbacks!
The flashback showing the duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan was prior to Attack of the Clones because Anakin seems to still have had hand and he became a Jedi Knight shortly after the beginning of the Clone Wars.

## Hoth Vibes
The theory that each part of this show has major callbacks to the corresponding Skywalker Sage film is still proving to be correct. Today's Part 5 felt a bit like Vader launching the assault on the Hoth base. Especially the shot of vader watching a ship escape.

## Fallen Order Sound Effects
Jedi: Fallen Order fan rejoice again this week. The sound effect of taking out troopers with a lightsaber sounds almost exactly like it does in Jedi: Fallen Order. It was especially noticeable when Kenobi was fighting the Purge Trooper.

## Reva
A lot of fans were wondering how Reva knew that Anakin is Darth Vader, we got the answer this week. Also, I like the revelation that Reva wants to kill Vader did not mean that she is "good", she hates Kenobi and Vader. This in between moral position is a fresh take on a Star Wars antagonist.

## Tala
I would have like to see more of this character but her sacrifice completed her story well enough. I'm glad we got a little of her defection story before she died.

## Grand Inquisitor
I think we were all expecting it but I'm glad he is not dead. I like knowing that they are not changing things setup in the animated shows.

## Luke
With one episode left I'm curious how this is going to go. It seems like Reva is going to Tatooine but I am still expecting a final battle between Vader and Kenobi. I also don't think Vader is going to Tatooine. So I guess we will see next week!
