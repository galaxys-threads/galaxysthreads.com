This first episode did exactly what we needed it to. It made us understand whereÂ Obi-Wan is in life right now. He has lost almost all of his hope and is hiding behind his responsibly to protect Luke. It showed us how dangerous the Inquisitors are and what the main conflict of the show is going to be. I'm 100% hooked and I'm so glad that I don't have to wait for part 2.

## Recap
I absolutely loved this recap, it was a great refreshed to those who have not seen the prequel moves recently. It set a really nice tone for the shows. Ending the recap with Yoda teasing an appearance from Qui-Gon Jinn seems significant.

## Order 66
Yet another view of Order 66. I love it! Some of the imagery reminds my of Grogu's vision of the same event from the Mandalorian. I wonder what the significance of showing us this will be. Now that I've seen the whole episode I feel like they are just make sure we know that way more Jedi survived Order 66 than we original thought. Or maybe teasing the origin of some of the Inquisitors.

## Sky Hopper and the Jawa
I loved seeing how Luke got the Skyhopper toy we saw him with in A New Hope. Also that whole interaction with "Ben" and the Jawa was hilarious!

## Qui-Gon Jinn
They had 2 teasings of Qui-Gon Jinn this episode. I'll be super surprised if we don't see Qui-Gon Jinn sometime in this series
## Leia
First off, Vivien Lyra Blair is a fantastic Princess Leia! I have a feeling that she is going to be the star of this show!

Is Leia reading minds a bit like Kylo Ren?

The chase scene was a little ridiculous. I know it's just a show and Vivien (Leia) is just a kid, but it was a little absurd how bad those kidnappers were.

Vivien Lyra Blair would be great in a Young Leia spinoff series.

## Reva
It's not star wars unless someone looses a hand!
