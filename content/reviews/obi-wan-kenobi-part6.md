## Overview
The season finale did not disappoint. It checked all of the boxes that we were still expecting.

## High Ground
Clearly they were trying to show Vader getting the "high ground" on Kenobi.

## It's not about lifting rocks
Obi-Wan lifting all of those rocks looked very similar to Rey lifting the rocks in The Last Jedi. I'm always for Star Wars validating Rey and the sequel trilogy.

## Jedi Master Kenobi
Old Ben was back in force this episode! The power of his force push attacks on Vader was an unexpected display of power that helps rectify some of the dialog in A New Hope between Kenobi and Vader.
> When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master.

## Vader Defeated
I thought what they did with Vader's mask and voice worked really well. The use of color helped express the emotion of the scene. It started off showing Anakin's face slightly red, then slightly blue/red, then bright red as he confirms his resolve in the Dark Side.

It defiantly reminded me of the battle between Ahsoka and Vader, which is still about 4 years after Kenobi. It does bring a new perspective to the to that fight. I wonder how much these Kenobi encounters and the Ahsoka encounter helped set the stage for Luke to be able to ultimately turn Anakin back to the light.

## Kenobi
I'm glad they had Obi-Wan admit that "Then my friend is truly dead". It helps connect this Obi-Wan to the attitude towards Vader that he we see in A New Hope.

## Palpatine
Palpatine showing up to explain why Vader is giving up the Kenobi search worked for me. He's not scared of Kenobi, he was just reminded that Kenobi shouldn't mean anything to Vader. Vader's rage toward Kenobi is coming from the little bit of "Anakin" left in him, and that "shouldn't" exist. It was a nice nod to Vader's future redemption.

## Beru
Beru was unexpectedly fierce! I thought it was great that she surprised Owen by having weapons hidden incase of someone coming for Luke. I guess those weapons were not enough when the Empire came in A New Hope.

## Reva
Her not being able to kill a child like Vader did showed that there is more good in her than evil. I'm curious where goes goes from here. It seems that she turned back to the light. She now has the opportunity to show up in other content, like the upcoming Jedi: Survivor.

## Hello There
Saving the "Hello there" quote for the end of the show was the right choice. It definitely stood out as something they forced in, but I still loved it! It also connects to "A New Hope" Ben, as those are the first words we hear him ever say.

## Qui-Gon Jinn
I was already expected to see Qui-Gon Jinn as soon as the show was announced, but with all of the Qui-Gon teases we got throughout the show, him not showing up would have been a huge disappointment. The way they did it was perfect. They waited until Kenobi both tapped back into the Force and accepted that Anakin was gone. I guess this means that Qui-Gon also has given up on Anakin being the chosen one.
