This has been my favorite episode so far. It was also some of the most brutally violent Star Wars we have gotten since the fight on Mustafar in Revenge of the Sith.

{{< spoiler-warning >}}

## Vader
Super cool throne in his castle! Also we just found out that Reva is going to die. We know she is not going to be able to permanently capture Obi-wan, so she is not going to live to regret failing Vader.

## Leia
Some of the conversations Leia and Obi-Wan had this episode were heartbreaking. Especially when she asked if he was her father.

It was also a little silly that Leia was better than Obi-Wan at not blowing their cover with the Stormtroopers.

We are also getting some confirmation that Leia is passively using the force to do some level of mind reading.

## Quinlan Vos
The mention of Quinlan Vos seems to reenforce the idea that many more Jedi survived order 66 than we previously thought.

## Force Sensitive Children
We don't know what the Empire is doing with force sensitive children, but we do know what they are going to do with Grogu (a force sensitive "child"). Is this yet another hint of the Palpatine cloning project? We also got significant hints of this in the Mandalorian and in Bad Batch. This really seems like more of that.

## Vader
Brutal... snapping a kids neck, dragging a screaming person through the street?

I did notice Reva's face during some of this, she didn't seems to care for it. Maybe she has a soft spot for children. We will have to see how she treats Leia.

The ice cold rage of holding Kenobi over the flames just to make him suffer was insane! Vader's anger at Kenobi has been festering for 10 years, and it shows.

The escape was a little silly. Vader couldn't jump over the flames? Or go around? Vader must have wanted Kenobi to get away. We will have to see if that is explained in the rest of the series.
