This article is aimed at someone looking to get into Star Wars. This can be an intimidating task due to the amount of movies, tv shows, games, books, and comics there are. This guide is to help you know where to start and not feel so lost.

> **Disclaimer:** There are many recommendations on how to watch Star Wars for the first time. This is only out recommendation. It does mean all others are wrong. There is no wrong way to enjoy Star Wars.

## The Skywalker Saga
There are 9 main movies (episodes), The Skywalker Saga. The one odd thing is that they were released out of order.
- The Original Trilogy - Episodes 4, 5, and 6 (1977-1893)
- The Prequel Trilogy - Episode 1, 2, and 3 (1999-2005)
- The Sequel Trilogy - Episode 7, 8, and 9 (2015-2019)
## Where to Start
Normally we recommend starting by watching the Skywalker Saga in release order. But Episode 4 - A New Hope (1977), while a fantastic move that started the franchise, it can seem a bit dated for the fresh eyes of a modern audience. For that reason, we recommend starting with Rogue One (2016), an immediate prequel to Episode 4. It's a really good modern movie that does not require much prior knowledge to enjoy. From there, we recommend watching the Skywalker Saga movies in release order.

| Released | Title |
| ------------ | ----- |
| 2016 | Rogue One |
| 1977 | Episode 4 - A New Hope |
| 1980 | Episode 5 - The Empire Strikes Back |
| 1983 | Episode 6 - Return of the Jedi |
| 1999 | Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace |
| 2002 | Episode 2 - Attack of the Clones |
| 2005 | Episode 3 - Revenge of the Sith
| 2015 | Episode 7 - The Force Awakens |
| 2017 | Episode 8 - The Last Jedi |
| 2019 | Episode 9 - The Rise of Skywalker |

## What Next

From here, you can consume as much or as little as you would like. It's all up to you! There are no wrong answers.

There are a couple other movies and TV show that you can watch from here. See our [Essential Timeline Guide](/guides/essential-timeline-guide) for a full listing of all of the video content available.

But our recommendation is to watch two of the animated TV shows, The Clone Wars and then Rebels. Don't let the fact that they are animated dissuade you, both are fantastic and many of theÂ characters from those shows are popping up in more recent live-action shows, like The Mandalorian (2019).

There is way more to Star Wars than just movies and TV shows. There are also books and video games that tell fantastic stories within the Star Wars universe that you starting to invest yourself in. See our [Canon Guide](/guides/canon-guide/) to see a full list of canon stores and where they takeplace in the Star Wars timeline.
