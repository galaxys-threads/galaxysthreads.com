For those of us that are heavily invested into the Star Wars Universe, it's natural for us to want to share it with our children. But what is the best way to do it?

There is no wrong answer to this question. But this was my experience:

## Our Family's Experience

I don't remember what my first Star Wars movie was. I just remember always knowing the story of the original trilogy. I do remember being excited for The Phantom Menace to be released. It has always been a big part of my life.

My wife has casually seen the moves and liked them, but never really got into until we had our son. Now I can confidently say that we are a Star Wars Family.

Before we had our son, I put a lot of thought into what was going to be the first movie I was going to show them. Once my son was born, all of that went out the window. We got him Star Wars toys, read him Star Wars bedtime stories, watched the movies with him, and played with lightsabers as soon as he was old enough to hold one.

## Our Recommendation for Younger Kids (or any age)
Some of the movies and shows have scenes that are not suitable for small children as they can be quite scary. But luckily there are some fantastic LEGO Star Wars shows that are safe for children of any age and enjoyable for the whole family. Droid Tales in particular has some really good jokes that you will only fully understand if you've already seen the movies. It's honestly hilarious!

- LEGO Star Wars The Freemaker Adventures

From here it's totally up to you and your family. If your children are a little bit older and ready for the movies, see our [Getting Started With Star Wars](/guides/getting-started-with-star-wars/) guide.
