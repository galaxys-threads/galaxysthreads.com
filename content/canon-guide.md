## What is this?

This is a simple reference chart to all (most) Star Wars Canon media. It's not meant to be exhaustive list, instead it's meant to be quick reference for the high level overview of the majority of content out there.

## Other Resources

The [Star Wars Timelines](https://a.co/d/3Ayzvxd) book is a really good reference, put out by Lucasfilm, that covers all Star Wars Canon stories at the time of printing. But it's not clear which media the story comes from.

[Youtini](https://youtini.com/timelines/canon) offers update-to-date information on all Star Wars content. They specialize in reading material, but have information on other media as well. Totally worth checking out for a deeper dive than what is offered here.

[Wookieepedia](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline_of_canon_media), maintained by a community of fans, has a much more extensive list of Star Wars Canon media. But can be a bit overwhelming.
